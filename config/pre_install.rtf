Before installing Cadabra2, you must make sure that the following prerequisites are satisfied:
* A working Python installation
You must have python3 installed on your system with the sympy package available. Python can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and sympy is installed by executing the command ‘python -m pip install sympy –-user’. Alternatively, use an Anaconda Python installation, available from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ .
* A working LaTeX distribution
MixTex is recommended and can be downloaded from https://miktex.org/download - this is the largest dependency.
