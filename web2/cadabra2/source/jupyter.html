<h1>Cadabra in Jupyter</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
<p>
  By virtue of the Cadabra kernel for Jupyter, it is possible to use
  Cadabra from a Jupyter notebook.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
  To obtain the Cadabra kernel for Jupyter, you need to either install
  it from Anaconda, or build it yourself. To install, make sure your
  conda installation is up-to-date with:
  <div class="output">
    conda update -n base -c defaults conda
  </div>
  Then add the required channels and update/install:
  <div class="output">
    conda config --add channels kpeeters
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda update --all
    conda install cadabra2-jupyter-kernel
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  If the above went well, you should now be able to start the Jupyter
  notebook as usual with
  <div class="output">
    jupyter notebook
  </div>
  The 'New' button in the top-right of the screen should then give you
  the option of creating a new notebook with a Cadabra kernel.
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Differences with Cadabra's own notebook</h2>
<p>
  When you use Cadabra within Jupyter, most things will work as in
  Cadabra's own notebook interface.
