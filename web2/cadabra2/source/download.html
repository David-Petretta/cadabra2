<h1>Download and install</h1>

<h2>Binary packages</h2>
<p>
  Packages for various Linux distributions and for Windows (beta!) are
  available for download here. Installation on macOS can be done
  through HomeBrew; see below. All these packages get updated on a
  semi-regular basis by yours truly; if you run into trouble, email me.
</p>
<p>
  Note that if your distribution has a <code>cadabra</code> package, this
  will contain a 1.x version, which is no longer being updated. The
  packages available here will eventually make it into the
  distributions as well, under the name <code>cadabra2</code>, but that
  may take a while. You can install versions 1.x and 2.x in parallel,
  they will not interfere with each other.
</p>
<p>
  Use at your own risk. Because of time constraints some of these
  packages receive almost no testing, so any feedback is welcome.

		Cadabra is available via the Homebrew package manager. First
		make sure that you have MacTeX installed, either by installing
		it directly, or by using homebrew with
		<code>brew tap caskroom/cask</code>
		<code>brew cask install mactex</code>
		After that, you can install Cadabra using
		<code>brew tap kpeeters/repo</code>		
		<code>brew install cadabra2</code>
		<code>pip3 install sympy gmpy2</code>
		Please not that this has not yet received a lot of testing; if
		you encounter problems, please
		email <a href="mailto:info@cadabra.science">info@cadabra.science</a>
		so they can be fixed and other people can benefit from it.

		You will need a Python3 installation from Anaconda and a LaTeX

		right now, please report any problems. Many thanks to

<p>
  Is your distribution not listed above? Either build Cadabra from
  source (see below) or send an email
  to <a href="mailto:info@cadabra.science">info@cadabra.science</a>
  to request a package for your distribution.
</p>


<h2>Build from source (Linux/macOS/Windows)</h2>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can compile Cadabra from source yourself (not difficult). The source
  is distributed via github, see the
   <a href="https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2">kpeeters/cadabra2</a>
  repository for more details, including the pre-requisites.
</p>
<p>
  You can build .deb and .rpm packages yourself when building from
  source, by running <code>sudo cpack</code> after a successful
  build. Note that on rpm systems this requires the use
  of <code>cmake3</code> and <code>cpack3</code>; the default cmake will lead to a broken package.
