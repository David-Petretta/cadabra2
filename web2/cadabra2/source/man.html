<h1>Manual pages</h1>
<p>
  Every algorithm and every property has a manual page with examples,
  which you can view online, or by pressing <code>F1</code> in the
  Cadabra notebook interface.
</p>
<p>
  For a description of the basics of Cadabra, you may be better off
  first reading or skimming through the <a href="help.html">reference guide</a>.
