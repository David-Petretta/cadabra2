<h1>Manual pages</h1>
<p>
  Every algorithm and every property has a manual page with examples,
  which you can view online here, or by pressing <code>F1</code> in
  the Cadabra notebook interface when your cursor is located on an
  algorithm or property name. Consider this the "dry" version of the
  documentation: to-the-point, but not very useful if you do not have
  an understanding of the big picture yet.
</p>
<p>
  For a more introductory description of the basics of Cadabra, you
  may be better off first reading or skimming through
  the <a href="tutorials.html">tutorials</a> or
  the <a href="help.html">Cadabra book</a>.
</p>
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>
  Cadabra comes with various add-on packages, which can be imported in
  the usual Python way with <code>import</code>. Their content is
  listed below.
